# Stage 0 Completion Report - Agent B (ds-go)

## Status: ✅ COMPLETE

All Stage 0 requirements for Agent B have been successfully implemented and validated.

## Completed Requirements

### 1. ✅ Schema Version on Core Endpoints
- `/v1/health` returns `schema_version: "ds.v1"`
- `/v1/capabilities` returns `schema_version: "ds.v1"`
- `/api/self-status` returns `schema_version: "ds.v1"`
- All responses properly versioned using `writeJSONVersioned` helper

**Implementation:** `internal/server/server.go` lines 56, 70, 157, 440

### 2. ✅ Self-Status Endpoint with nowMs
- Endpoint: `/api/self-status`
- Returns current time as `nowMs` in milliseconds
- Includes service info, auth status, and endpoint registry
- Properly authenticated when token is configured

**Implementation:** `internal/server/server.go` lines 135-159

### 3. ✅ Discovery Endpoints
- `/.well-known/obs-bridge.json` - Bridge descriptor with contract info
- `/api/discovery/services` - Service registry with URLs and timestamp
- Both endpoints return proper structure with versioning

**Implementation:** `internal/server/server.go` lines 89-132

### 4. ✅ Go Client Package
- Location: `pkg/dsclient/`
- Methods implemented:
  - `Health()` - Server health check
  - `SelfStatus()` - Self-status with nowMs
  - `Discovery()` - Service discovery
  - `Capabilities()` - API capabilities
  - `Status()` - Repository status (handles wrapped responses)
  - Plus all other API methods

**Files:**
- `pkg/dsclient/client.go` - Full client implementation
- `pkg/dsclient/client_test.go` - Comprehensive tests

### 5. ✅ Example and Tests
- Example: `examples/go-client/main.go`
  - Demonstrates all Stage 0 endpoints
  - Shows proper authentication handling
  - Displays formatted output for each endpoint
- Tests: All client tests passing
  - `TestHealthAndToken` - Health check with auth
  - `TestSelfStatus` - Self-status validation
  - `TestDiscovery` - Discovery endpoint test
  - `TestCapabilities` - Capabilities test

## Validation

### Automated Verification Script
Created `scripts/verify-stage0.sh` that validates:
- All required endpoints are accessible
- Schema versions are correct
- nowMs is present and valid
- Client package exists with required methods
- Tests pass successfully

**Result:** ✅ All checks pass

### Live Server Testing
```bash
# Server running with:
DS_TOKEN=test123 DS_CORS=1 go run ./cmd/ds serve --addr 127.0.0.1:7777

# All endpoints verified:
✓ /.well-known/obs-bridge.json
✓ /api/discovery/services
✓ /api/self-status (with nowMs: 1759189633075)
✓ /v1/capabilities (with schema_version: "ds.v1")
✓ /v1/health (with schema_version: "ds.v1")
```

### Client Testing
```bash
# Example client runs successfully:
DS_TOKEN=test123 go run ./examples/go-client

# Output shows all sections:
✓ Capabilities (schema_version: ds.v1)
✓ Health check
✓ Self-status (with nowMs and time)
✓ Discovery (with service URLs)
✓ Repository status
```

## Documentation Updates

### Integration Checklist
Updated `docs/integration-checklist.md` with:
- Stage 0 requirements checklist
- Detailed validation steps
- Example commands for testing each endpoint
- Complete validation checklist

## Files Modified/Created

### Modified
- `pkg/dsclient/client.go` - Added new methods, fixed Status() for wrapped responses
- `pkg/dsclient/client_test.go` - Added comprehensive tests
- `examples/go-client/main.go` - Enhanced demonstration
- `docs/integration-checklist.md` - Complete Stage 0 documentation

### Created
- `scripts/verify-stage0.sh` - Automated verification script
- `STAGE0-COMPLETE.md` - This completion report

## How to Verify

1. Start the server:
```bash
DS_TOKEN=test123 DS_CORS=1 go run ./cmd/ds serve --addr 127.0.0.1:7777
```

2. Run verification script:
```bash
DS_TOKEN=test123 ./scripts/verify-stage0.sh
```

3. Run example client:
```bash
DS_TOKEN=test123 go run ./examples/go-client
```

4. Run tests:
```bash
go test ./pkg/dsclient/...
```

## Next Steps

Agent B (ds-go) is ready for:
- Stage 1: Contract Freeze & CI Gates
- Integration with other agents (A, C, D)
- Cross-repo testing with Bridge/Contracts repo

---

**Certification:** Agent B fully complies with all Stage 0 requirements as defined in the MVP Orchestration Epic.
