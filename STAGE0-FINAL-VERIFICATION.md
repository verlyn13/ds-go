# Stage 0 Final Verification Report - Agent B (ds-go)

## Executive Summary

✅ **ALL STAGE 0 REQUIREMENTS PASSED**

Agent B (ds-go) has successfully completed all Stage 0 requirements with additional improvements addressing the gaps identified in the review.

## Verification Results

### ✅ Core Endpoints (schema_version: "ds.v1")

All core endpoints properly return `schema_version: "ds.v1"`:

| Endpoint | Status | Implementation |
|----------|--------|----------------|
| `/v1/capabilities` | ✅ Pass | Returns schema_version in response |
| `/v1/health` | ✅ Pass | Includes schema_version field |
| `/v1/status` | ✅ Pass | Wrapped response with {schema_version, data} |
| `/v1/scan` | ✅ Pass | Returns versioned object |
| `/v1/organize/plan` | ✅ Pass | Wrapped array response |
| `/v1/organize/apply` | ✅ Pass | Versioned response |
| `/v1/fetch` | ✅ Pass | Versioned response |
| `/v1/policy/check` | ✅ Pass | Versioned response |
| `/v1/exec` | ✅ Pass | Versioned response |

**Note:** SSE endpoints (`/v1/status/sse`, `/v1/fetch/sse`) stream raw data without wrapping, which is acceptable for event streams.

### ✅ Self-Status Endpoint

`/api/self-status` endpoint fully implemented:
- Returns `nowMs` as epoch milliseconds (e.g., 1759190025760)
- Includes `schema_version: "ds.v1"`
- Contains auth flags: `tokenRequired`, `corsEnabled`
- Provides endpoints map with all available paths
- Returns service identifier: `"service": "ds"`

### ✅ Discovery Endpoints

All discovery endpoints operational:

| Endpoint | Status | Features |
|----------|--------|----------|
| `/.well-known/obs-bridge.json` | ✅ Pass | Contract version, schema version, endpoint list |
| `/api/discovery/services` | ✅ Pass | DS service URLs, token presence, timestamp |
| `/api/discovery/capabilities` | ✅ Pass | Minimal capability descriptor |
| `/api/discovery/openapi` | ✅ Pass | Alias to OpenAPI spec |

### ✅ Go Client Package

Complete client implementation in `pkg/dsclient/`:
- All required methods implemented: `Health()`, `SelfStatus()`, `Discovery()`, `Capabilities()`
- Handles both raw and wrapped API responses
- Full test coverage with passing tests
- Authentication support with bearer tokens

### ✅ Example and Tests

- **Example**: `examples/go-client/main.go` demonstrates all Stage 0 endpoints
- **Tests**: Comprehensive test suite in `pkg/dsclient/client_test.go`
- All tests passing: `go test ./pkg/dsclient/...`

## Addressed Gaps

### 1. OpenAPI Documentation (✅ RESOLVED)

Added missing discovery endpoints to `internal/server/openapi.yaml`:
- `/.well-known/obs-bridge.json`
- `/api/discovery/services`
- `/api/discovery/capabilities`
- `/api/discovery/openapi`
- `/openapi.yaml`

### 2. SSE Endpoint Behavior (✅ VERIFIED)

Confirmed SSE endpoints work correctly:
- `/v1/status/sse` - Streams repository status events
- `/v1/fetch/sse` - Streams fetch progress events
- Both return raw data without schema_version wrapping (acceptable for streams)

## Validation Scripts

### Primary Verification
```bash
DS_TOKEN=test123 ./scripts/verify-stage0.sh
```
Result: ✅ All checks pass

### Secondary Verification
```bash
DS_TOKEN=test123 ./scripts/verify-ds-services.sh
```
Result: ✅ All probes completed

## Build and Test Status

```bash
# Build verification
go build ./...  # ✅ Success

# Test execution
go test ./pkg/dsclient/...  # ✅ Pass

# Example client
DS_TOKEN=test123 go run ./examples/go-client  # ✅ Works
```

## Repository Scaffolding

Tracking infrastructure in place:
- Issue templates: MVP Epic, Stage Tracker, Task
- PR template with validation gates
- Auto-labeler configuration
- Integration checklist documentation

## Files Modified/Created

### Modified
- `internal/server/openapi.yaml` - Added discovery endpoint documentation
- `pkg/dsclient/client.go` - Enhanced to handle wrapped responses

### Created
- `scripts/verify-stage0.sh` - Comprehensive Stage 0 validation
- `STAGE0-COMPLETE.md` - Initial completion report
- `STAGE0-FINAL-VERIFICATION.md` - This final verification

## Certification

2. ✅ `/api/self-status` includes `nowMs` timestamp
3. ✅ Discovery endpoints fully implemented
4. ✅ Go client package with all methods
5. ✅ Example and tests present and passing
6. ✅ OpenAPI documentation complete
7. ✅ SSE endpoints functional

**Stage 0 Status: COMPLETE** ✅
